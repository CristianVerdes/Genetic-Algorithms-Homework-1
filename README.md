# Genetic-Algorithms-Homework-1
The idea to this project is to try to maximize (finding 0) 4 functions (rast_function, griew_function, rosen_function, six_function) using:
- [Hill climbing] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing)
- [Simulated annealing] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing)

This algorithms are fast and can find our solution but the idea was to understand that Genetic Algorithms can be even faster. (See G.A. Homework 2)
